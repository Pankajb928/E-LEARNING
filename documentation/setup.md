Sure, here's a step-by-step guide to upload your project to GitHub:

### Step 1: Install Git
If you haven't already installed Git, you can download and install it from [here](https://git-scm.com/).

### Step 2: Create a GitHub Account
If you don't have a GitHub account, you'll need to sign up for one at [GitHub](https://github.com/).

### Step 3: Create a New Repository
1. Log in to your GitHub account.
2. Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner of the page and select "New repository".
3. Fill out the necessary information for your repository, such as the repository name, description, and choose whether it's public or private.
4. Click on "Create repository".

### Step 4: Initialize your Local Repository
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project directory using the `cd` command.

### Step 5: Initialize Git in your project directory
```
git init
```

### Step 6: Add your files to the Git staging area
```
git add .
```
This adds all files in the current directory to the staging area.

### Step 7: Commit your changes
```
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
Replace "Initial commit" with a meaningful message describing your changes.

### Step 8: Link your local repository to the remote GitHub repository
```
git remote add origin <repository URL>
```
Replace `<repository URL>` with the URL of your GitHub repository. You can find this on the repository page.

### Step 9: Push your changes to GitHub
```
git push -u origin master
```
This command pushes your changes from your local `master` branch to the `master` branch on GitHub. If you're using a different branch, replace `master` with your branch name.

### Step 10: Enter your GitHub username and password
When prompted, enter your GitHub username and password to authenticate the push.

### Step 11: Check GitHub
Refresh your GitHub repository page, and you should see your files there.

That's it! Your project is now uploaded to GitHub.
