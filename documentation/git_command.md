# Documentation for Uploading Documentation

This document outlines the process of uploading documentation to a repository using Git commands.

## Prerequisites
- Git installed on your local machine
- Access to the repository you want to upload documentation to
- Basic knowledge of Git commands

## Uploading Documentation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone [repository_url]
```
Replace `[repository_url]` with the URL of the repository you want to clone.

### 2. Navigate to the Repository Directory
Navigate to the cloned repository directory using the `cd` command:
```bash
cd [repository_name]
```
Replace `[repository_name]` with the name of the cloned repository directory.

### 3. Switch to the Master Branch
Switch to the master branch using the `git checkout` command:
```bash
git checkout master
```

### 4. Pull Latest Changes from Master
Pull the latest changes from the master branch of the remote repository using the following command:
```bash
git pull origin master
```

### 5. Create a New Branch
Create a new branch for uploading documentation using the `git checkout -b` command:
```bash
git checkout -b upload_documentation
```
This command creates a new branch named `upload_documentation` and switches to it.

### 6. Add Documentation Files
Add the documentation files you want to upload to the repository using the `git add` command:
```bash
git add [documentation_files]
```
Replace `[documentation_files]` with the names of the documentation files you want to add. You can also use `.` to add all files.

### 7. Check Branch Status
Check the status of the branch and the files you've added using the `git status` command:
```bash
git status
```
This command displays information about the current branch, modified files, and untracked files.

### 8. Commit Changes
Commit the added documentation files to the branch using the `git commit -m` command:
```bash
git commit -m "Add documentation files"
```
Replace `"Add documentation files"` with a meaningful commit message describing the changes you've made.

### 9. Push Changes to Remote Repository
Push the committed changes to the remote repository using the `git push` command:
```bash
git push origin upload_documentation
```
Replace `upload_documentation` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you can upload documentation to a repository using Git commands. Make sure to review your changes before pushing them to the remote repository and to follow any specific guidelines or conventions set by the project team.
